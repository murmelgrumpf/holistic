# Holistic
Holistic is a small project that aims to provide education in a slightly different manner. We believe in the right for
everyone to be educated, no matter their background.

This project is in it's early days. We plan to make it bigger and eventually launch a self sustaining company. But that
is future talk. For now this is a prototype to see if this is even viable and if people would like to use it.

This whole readme is a work in progress as well as the project itself, but we wanted to get the license straight before
publishing on Github.

## !! Important !! - This software is not Open source
This software is not Open source. We want to communicate that clearly. It is released under the Elastic License 2.0.
That means you are free to use and modify it, as long as you
1. Don't provide the product to others as a hosted or managed service
2. You may not circumvent the license key functionality or remove/obscure features protected by license keys
3. You may not remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices

Don't be confused, for now we do not have a license key, but that will come sooner or later.
Many people call it Source available(our preferred term) or Source known, that means that everyone can see and fork
the Code, but there are restrictions on usage.

### Why not Open source?
We want to be as transparent as possible. That's why we release the source code for people to see and maybe learn a
few things along the way. That does not mean that we want to give everyone the right to use and distribute our software.
We are strong believers in Open source, but this is not a Open source product and it most likely never will be. We hope
with providing this statement, we have explained ourselfs enough for you to accept our decision. We invite you to fork
the Repo and Tinker with it, maybe try to understand the not very common stack(a very nice one at that btw), but we
also ask that you respect the boundries we have set. 

Thank you for reading all this. It was important for us to communicate that, especially because of so many companies
misusing the term Open source.
